# Copilot Instructions for vishaljavalkar-ai.github.io

## Overview
This project is a trial website hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as a personal portfolio and showcases various projects.

## Architecture
- **Main Components**: The primary files are `index.html` and `Bio.html`, which serve as the landing page and personal biography, respectively.
- **Data Flow**: The website is static, meaning data flow is minimal and primarily involves HTML and CSS.

## Developer Workflows
- **Building**: No specific build process is required for static sites. Simply edit the HTML files and push changes to the repository.
- **Testing**: Manual testing is performed by viewing the site in a browser after changes are made.
- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and debug any issues.

## Project Conventions

- **Cross-Component Communication**: As a static site, there is no complex communication between components.

## Key Files
- **[index.html](index.html)**: The main entry point of the website.
- **[Bio.html](Bio.html)**: Contains personal information and project details.
